title: Namelint started!
---

I have been using Go for some projects recently: I like it and am quite productive, but had always been troubled by Amos's
[I want off Mr. Golang's Wild Ride](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride)
blog post.

He's right, of course, but at the same time: should you really have to deal with such difficult file names?

So, to both learn some Rust, and make sure your non-Rust file handling code works, I'm starting **namelint**, a tool to check for troublesome file names.  Ideally, it will catch:

* Security issues/hack attempts
* Cross-platform portability problems
* Names that require special escaping in various shells
* Customizable naming conventions

What it won't do:

* Rename the failing files
* Check the file contents: it will never open a file[^1]
* Check attributes
