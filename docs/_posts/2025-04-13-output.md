title: Output from namelint
h1: Output
---

We are designing what running namelint should produce.  Criteria:

* Guaranteed UTF-8: no invalid Unicode UTF-8 byte sequences
* Nothing unsafe: looking at the output shouldn't mess up your terminal
* Separate results (ex: lint errors) from tooling messages (ex: errors loading rules)
* Distinct: filenames should be as close to actual as possible, but still show what is going on behind the scenes
* Nice output for humans looking at a tty
* Nice output when running in CI

## What goes where

* Stdout: Progress updates (controlled by a `--progress` option)
* Stdout: human-readable lint results
* Stderr: tooling messages (controlled by a `--loglevel` option)
* File: machine-readable (=JSON) lint results (controlled by a `--output` option)

## Details

Progress is one of `none`, `dots` or `bar`.  If stdout is a tty, the default is `bar`.  Otherwise the default is `dots`.

The JSON output has:
* the `filename` if the filename is UTF-8 and has no null bytes.  All non-ASCII characters will use the escaped form (`\uXXXX`), so the file should be 7-bit ASCII safe.
* a `bytes` version of the filename if there are any non-Posix characters.
* a `display` version of the filename, with "unsafe" characters replaced by `?`.  The definition of "unsafe" to be determined later.
