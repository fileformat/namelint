I did some research looking for an existing program but did not find one that matched what I want to build.

IMHO, anything that isn't in Rust or C/C++ is going to be too high level and not detect an important set of problems.

- [ls-lint](https://ls-lint.org/) - Go, focused on file name conventions ([source](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint))

- [eslint-plugin-check-file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-check-file) - JavaScript, tests files in directories against one or more patterns ([source](https://github.com/dukeluo/eslint-plugin-check-file/tree/main))

- [eslint-plugin-unicorn's filename-case](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/main/docs/rules/filename-case.md) - JavaScript, enforces file name case style

- [eslint-plugin-filenames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-filenames) - JavaScript, focused on file naming conventions, last updated in 2018 but still used ([source](https://github.com/selaux/eslint-plugin-filenames))

- [batista/lint-filenames](https://github.com/batista/lint-filenames) - JavaScript, tests a single regex against all files in a directory

- [Rich Jenks' filename regex](https://richjenks.com/filename-regex/) - a regex that tests for cross-plaform issues (including safe for URLs)

- [sindresorhus/filename-reserved-regex](https://github.com/sindresorhus/filename-reserved-regex) - NPM library with regexes for reserved characters and MS-DOS reserved names.

- [filesan](https://github.com/BonnyAD9/filesan) - Rust, a library that sanitizes strings so they can safely be used as file names.  I.e. if someone gives you a string as a file name, this will make sure it is safe.

- [super-linter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-linters-and-code-analyzers) - a meta-linter that runs other linters.  It has a huge list of available linters, but all are focused on file contents, not names.

- [detox](https://github.com/dharple/detox) - C, renames files to make them easier to work with under Linux and other Unix-like
operating systems

- [**notox**](https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans/notox) - Rust, a command line utility that reports (and optionally fixes) toxic file names

- [@another_works/namelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@another_works/namelint/v/1.0.1) - JavaScript, test file names and internal names against a user-supplied regex.

- [dougpuob/cppnamelint](https://github.com/dougpuob/cppnamelint) - C++, check C++ source for file, function, variable and parameter names.

- [joshwnj/name-lint](https://github.com/joshwnj/name-lint) - JavaScript, regex rule per file extension, last updated in 2019

- [CrossRename](https://pypi.org/project/CrossRename/) - Python, focused on portability between Linux and Windows ([source](https://github.com/Jemeni11/CrossRename))

- [spf13/pathologize](https://github.com/spf13/pathologize) - Go, focused on creating portable file names

- [ClaireCJS/fix_unicode_filenames](https://github.com/ClaireCJS/fix_unicode_filenames) - Python, renames files with Unicode and/or troublesome characters

- [cfgong/filename-standardizer](https://github.com/cfgong/filename-standardizer) - bash script to change case style of files/directories

- [exponential-decay/fndec](https://github.com/exponential-decay/fndec) - Go, guess the character encoding of your filenames, last updated in 2018.  I'm a little worried that this exists, since we are planning on only supporting UTF-8...

- [jonthysell/AsciiRename](https://github.com/jonthysell/AsciiRename) - C, renames everything to ASCII
