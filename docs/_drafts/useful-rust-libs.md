* [file/dir helper libs on Blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates#section-cli-tools-subsection-utility)
* [cloudflare/wildcard](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildcard) - the [announcement blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wildcard-rules/) goes into detail, and has a list of alternatives they considered.
* [clap_mangen](https://crates.io/crates/clap_mangen) - generate a `man` page
* [any_ascii](https://crates.io/crates/any_ascii) - converts any unicode char to ASCII.  Lossy, but maybe useful for printing filenames to the console.
