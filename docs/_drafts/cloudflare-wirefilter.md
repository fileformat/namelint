title: Define Rules with expressions
tag: future
---

Cloudflare has a [https://github.com/cloudflare/wirefilter](rust library) that supports WireShark-like filter expressions.  [Blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-fast-interpreters-in-rust/).

The entire [Ruleset Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/) is pretty good.

This would be a nice enhancement: you could define rules with and/or/in, comparison operators, functions, etc.
