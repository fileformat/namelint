  - description: |
      These filenames are reserved in MS-DOS (and thus Microsoft Windows) and cannot be used for files or directories
      if they are to be accessed from MS-DOS or Windows computers. This rule is case-insensitive.
    regex:
      pattern: "^(AUX|COM[1-9]|CON|LPT[1-9]|NUL|PRN)([.].*)?$"
      case_insensitive: true
      expect: "nonmatch"
    rule_id: "no-msdos-reserved"
    title: "No MS-DOS reserved filenames (LPT1, COM1, etc.)"
    examples:
      - value: "COM1"
        expect: "fail"
      - value: "com1"
        expect: "fail"
      - value: "com11"
        expect: "pass"
      - value: "COM"
        expect: "pass"
      - value: "COM1.txt"
        expect: "fail"
      - value: "NUL"
        expect: "fail"
      - value: "NULL"
        expect: "pass"
